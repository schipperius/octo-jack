par2-sen1: Today, I'm fashionably dressed with a new grey coat with covered buttons and matching waistcoat, dark trousers, short turnover shirt collar, and a floppy bow tie.

par2-sen2: I'm heading east down Lake Street with the smell of horse manure hanging heavy in the air. 

par2-sen3: I’m glad it’s not raining, as this street would turn into a virtual cesspool of liquefied manure, and that would surely ruin my new buttoned down spats.

par2-sen4: I’m making my way to the first elevated railway built in Chicago, nicknamed the 'Alley L'.

par3-sen1: The South Side 'L' first opened a year ago and they just extended the line, all the way to 63rd street and Jackson Park.

par3-sen2: And that's where I'm headed this morning.

par3-sen3: For a nickel, I will board one of the new wooden cars, and get pulled by a steam locomotive for about 6 miles until I reach the south-west entrance of the World's Columbian Exposition.

par3-sen4: This trip will take about 30 minutes, I have just enough time to flip through my 'Authentic Visitor's Guide' book and decide where to go first.

par4-sen1: I pay the 50 cent admission fee and step out of the terminus station and onto the Fair grounds. I am greeted with an overwhelming cacophony of music, smells, voices and crowds.

par4-sen2: The sound of the Columbian Chorus or Orchestra drifts in from the lakefront as I try to ignore the smell of the nearby stock pavilions. Large crowds are in front of me.

par4-sen3: 

par4-sen4: The first site before me is the Administration building. A 55,000 square foot doomed building, all covered in white stucco.

fn1: <li id="fn:8.1">This is a modified image from <a href="http://collider.com/vintage-gi-joe-hot-wheels-pez/" title="Cracker Jack">Collider</a> a website that defines itself as "the online destination for breaking news, incisive content and the lowdown on imminent trends... WTF is that? <a href="#fnref:8.1">&#8617;</a></li>

fn2: <li id="fn:8.2">When German immigrant Frederick “Fritz” William Rueckheim and his brother Louis concocted an early version of their popcorn, molasses and peanut confection at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, they called it simply, “Candied Popcorn and Peanuts.” But in 1896 Fritz devised a way to keep the popcorn kernels separated by adding a small quantity of oil to each spinning vat. Prior to this innovation, the product stuck together in chunks. <a href="http://collider.com/vintage-gi-joe-hot-wheels-pez/" title="Cracker Jack">In 1896</a>, the first batch of “Cracker Jack” was made. An enthusiastic customer is said to have coined its household name by exclaiming, “That’s crackerjack!”. <a href="#fnref:8.2">&#8617;</a></li>
