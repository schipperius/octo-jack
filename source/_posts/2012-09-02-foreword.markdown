#----- Article Footnotes -----#
fn1: <li id="fn:1.1">This modified image is from a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19645273" title="BBC News">BBC News</a> article, titled, 'Wife of Jesus'. Retrieved September 19, 2012. For those who can read this ancient papyrus, it suggests that Jesus had a wife. I suspect his wife was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>. There have been many suggestions of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_bloodline">Jesus Bloodline</a> but I would like to push the hypothesis a bit further. You see, I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales">Princess Diana</a> was the matrilineal descendant of Mary Magdalene, which means of course, that the Princes William and Harry are the living descendants of Mary and Jesus. I know this sounds absurd, but so do a lot of things before they become accepted as the truth. Today, acceptance usually involves science, and I believe the <a href="https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/about/">Genographic Project</a> from the <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic Society</a> will soon shed some light on this topic. <a href="#fnref:1.1">&#8617;</a></li>

fn2: <li id="fn:1.2">I'm not sure if this will ever be written, I will just have to be patient. <a href="#fnref:1.2">&#8617;</a></li>
