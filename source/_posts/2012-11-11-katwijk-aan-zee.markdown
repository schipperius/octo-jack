par1-sen1: It is here at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katwijk_aan_Zee">Katwijk aan Zee</a> that a Roman fortification known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittenburg">Brittenburg</a> emerged out of the sand after a storm in 1520 and a couple more times in 1552 and 1562, only to mysteriously disappear again.

par1-sen2: Brittenburg was the western most position of the Roman borders defensive line, having been built along the river Rijn after Caesar&rsquo;s conquest of Gual in 52 BC.

par1-sen3: The northern border of the Roman Empire was known as the Limes Germanicus<sup class="footnote fn8"><a href="/author#fn8">[8]</a></sup>, a line of fortifications that stretched from the North Sea at Katwik, following the natural boundary of the Lower Rhine branches, that included the modern Oude Rijn, and followed the Rhine to its source in the Swiss Alps.

par1-sen4: The Limes Germanicus was designed to protect the newly acquired lands from the raiding Germanic tribes from which I originate. For around 450 years, from around 55 BC to around 410 AD, the southern part of the Netherlands was integrated into the Roman Empire. During this time the Romans in the Netherlands had an enormous influence on the lives and culture of the people who lived in the Netherlands at the time and (indirectly) on the generations that followed. So, I was born within 30Km of the northern border of the Roman Empire.
