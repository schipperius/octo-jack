par1-sen1: Sitting at a monthly staff meeting with Halloween fast approaching, the discussion turned to the various activities and festivities being planned.

par1-sen2: The usual Halloween Dance, door decorating contests (my class won that year&#033;), classroom parties with apple bobbing contests, and so on.

par1-sen3: As I tuned out of the conversation around me, I began thinking about that orange squash thing that gets carved up every fall for Halloween, but could not remember what it was called.

par1-sen4: I thought to myself; Jacklight, Jack Frost, jack knife, Jack and Jill... I knew it was Jack something&#033; I began writing, Jack the ripper, Jack and the beanstalk, Jack fruit, Jackass.

par2-sen2: I reached for a dictionary from the shelf behind me, the letter J it said, '...is the tenth letter of the alphabet, and the last of the 26 letters to be included.'

par2-sen3: So I looked up the word Jack, and found, every-man-jack, jack-a-dandy, jack-a-roo, Jack Ketch, jack ladder, jack leg.

par2-sen4: By now, I had more than half a page of words and phrases that had the word Jack in it, jack off, jack shit, jack rabbit, Jack Horner, jack ass (I wrote that one twice&#033;)

#----- Row2 Col1 -----#
par3-sen1: The word jack was all over the place; people, games, animals, plants, and other sorted things, but I still couldn't remember....

par3-sen2: A teacher sitting to my right noticed my distraction, I showed her my list and asked, 'What is it?' She politely replied, 'Jack O'Lantern'.

par3-sen3: Oh ya, that was it&#033;

par4-sen1: And thus began my quest, to learn about the origin and usage of the word 'Jack', the letter 'j' and even the sound 'dzh'.

par4-sen2: A journey that would take me back to the Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Old Testament, the Semites and Phoenicians.

par4-sen3: The 1358 French Revolt and the rest of the Middle Ages, Dutch Printers, Geneva Bibles, and the Industrial Revolution.

par4-sen4: Botany, zoology and even some geology, famous people (and some not so famous), tools in the garage and even appliances in the kitchen.
