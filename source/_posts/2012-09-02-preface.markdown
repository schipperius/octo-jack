para1: <p>Sitting at a monthly staff meeting with Halloween fast approaching, the discussion turned to the various activities and festivities being planned.</p><p>The usual Halloween Dance, door decorating contests (my class won that year&#033;), classroom parties with apple bobbing contests, and so on.</p><p>As I tuned out of the conversation around me, I began thinking about that orange squash thing that gets carved up every fall for Halloween, but could not remember what it was called.</p><p>I thought to myself; Jacklight, Jack Frost, jack knife, Jack and Jill... I knew it was Jack something&#033;</p>

para2: <p id="fnref:1.3">I began writing, Jack the ripper, Jack and the beanstalk, Jack fruit, Jackass.</p><p>I reached for a dictionary from the shelf behind me, the letter J it said, '...is the tenth letter of the alphabet, and the last of the 26 letters to be included.' So I looked up the word Jack, and found, every-man-jack, jack-a-dandy, jack-a-roo, Jack Ketch, jack ladder, jack leg.</p><p>By now, I had more than half a page of words and phrases that had the word Jack in it, jack off, jack shit, jack rabbit, Jack Horner, jack ass (I wrote that one twice&#033;) <sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn:1.3" rel="tooltip">3</a></sup></p>

para3: <p> The word jack was all over the place; people, games, animals, plants, phrases, and other sorted things, but I still couldn't remember....</p><p>a teacher sitting on my right noticed my distraction, I showed her my list and and ask, 'What is it?' She politely replied, 'Jack O'Lantern'.</p><p>Oh ya, that was it&#033;</p>
