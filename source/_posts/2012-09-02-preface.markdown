intro1: It was fall, late 1994 and I was a junior high, math and science teacher in a small, rural community school located somewhere in the vast emptiness of the barren Canadian prairies, where I could see, uninterrupted, from one horizon to the other.

#----- Article Paragraphs -----#

para1: <p>Sitting at a monthly staff meeting with Halloween fast approaching, the discussion turned to the various activities and festivities being planned.</p><p>The usual Halloween Dance, door decorating contests (my class won that year&#033;), classroom parties with apple bobbing contests, and so on.</p><p>As I tuned out of the conversation around me, I began thinking about that orange squash thing that gets carved up every fall for Halloween, but could not remember what it was called.</p><p>I thought to myself; Jacklight, Jack Frost, jack knife, Jack and Jill... I knew it was Jack something&#033;</p>

para2: <p>I began writing, Jack the ripper, Jack and the beanstalk, Jack fruit, Jackass... a teacher sitting on my right noticed my distraction, I explained my situation and she politely replied, 'Jack 'o Lantern'.</p><p>Oh ya, that was it&#033;</p><p>By now, I had half a page of words and phrases that had Jack in it, jack off, jack shit, jack rabbit, Jack Horner, jack ass (I wrote that one twice&#033;). People, games, animals, plants, and other sorted things, how did this all happen&#63;</p>

para3: <p>I reached for a dictionary<sup class="footnote fn2"><a href="/preface#fn2">[2]</a></sup> from the shelf behind me, the letter J it said, '...is the tenth letter of the alphabet, and the last of the 26 letters to be included.' So I looked up the word Jack, and found, every-man-jack, jack-a-dandy, jack-a-roo, Jack Ketch, jack ladder, jack leg.</p>

para4: <p>And thus began my quest, to understand the origin and usage of the word Jack and the letter j.</p>

para5: <p>A journey that would take me back to the Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Old Testament, the Semites and Phoenicians, the 1358 French Revolt and the rest of the Middle Ages, the Dutch Printers and the King James Bible, the Industrial Revolution, botany, zoology and even some geology, famous people (and some not so famous), the kitchen and even the garage.</p>
