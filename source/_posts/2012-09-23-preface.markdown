par1-sen1: Sitting at a monthly staff meeting with Halloween fast approaching, the discussion turned to the various activities and festivities being planned.

par1-sen2: The usual Halloween Dance, door decorating contests (my class won that year&#033;), classroom parties with apple bobbing contests, and so on.

par1-sen3: As I tuned out of the conversation around me, I began thinking about that orange squash thing that gets carved up every fall for Halloween, but could not remember what it was called.

par1-sen4: I thought to myself; Jacklight, Jack Frost, jack knife, Jack and Jill... I knew it was Jack something&#033; I began writing, Jack the ripper, Jack and the beanstalk, Jack fruit, Jackass.

par2-sen1: I reached for a dictionary from the shelf behind me, the letter J it said, '...is the tenth letter of the alphabet, and the last of the 26 letters to be included.'

par2-sen2: So I looked up the word Jack, and found; every-man-jack, jack-a-dandy, jack-a-roo, Jack Ketch, jack ladder, jack leg.

par2-sen3: 

par2-sen4: By now, I had more than half a page of words and phrases that had the word Jack in it, jack off, jack shit, jack rabbit, Jack Horner, jack ass (I wrote that one twice&#033;)

#----- Row2 Col1 -----#
par3-sen1: The word jack was all over the place; people, games, animals, plants, and other sorted things, but I still couldn't remember....

par3-sen2: A teacher sitting to my right noticed my distraction, I showed her my list and asked, 'What is it?' She politely replied, 'Jack O'Lantern'.

par3-sen3:

par3-sen4: Oh ya, that was it&#033;

par4-sen1: And thus began my quest, to learn about the origin and usage of the word 'Jack', the letter 'j' and even the sound 'dzh'.

par4-sen2: A journey that would take me back to the Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Old Testament, the Semites and Phoenicians.

par4-sen3: The 1358 French Revolt and the rest of the Middle Ages, Dutch Printers, Geneva Bibles, and the Industrial Revolution.

par4-sen4: Botany, zoology and even some geology, famous people (and some not so famous), tools in the garage and even appliances in the kitchen.


#----- Article Footnotes -----#
fn1: <li id="fn:2.1">The image of a pile of rocks that have been cleared from the prairie to prepare the land for farming is from  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rostrus/2272092161/in/set-72157603928275552" title="Cairn, Suffield Alberta">Robert Strusievicz</a>.  Of course, it was too dry for crops to grow, and most settlements were eventually abandoned. The book, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Empire-Dust-David-C-Jones/dp/1552380858">Empire of Dust</a> details the settlement and abandonment of the dry belt area of southeastern Alberta Canada, a fascinating read of early Canadian history.

fn2: <li id="fn:2.2">The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Prairies" title="The Canadian Prairies">Canadian prairies</a> is a region in western Canada. The word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie">prairie</a> usually refers to a type of grassland, and in Canada, the 'true' prairies only occur in the southern reaches of Alberta and Saskatchewan. <a href="#fnref:2.2">&#8617;</a></li>

The text is a reproduction of the original scribbled notes that illustrate the beginnings of the Book of Jack. Image retrieved September 12, 2012. <a href="#fnref:2.3">&#8617;</a></li>

fn4: <li id="fn:2.4">This is a modified image of an illustration I found on the Web in the mid-nineties, it was part of a presentation made by Sage Foley. However, I recently found the same image on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jack-o-lantern.svg">Wikipedia</a>, the earliest image is dated October 2006. <a href="fnref:2.4">&#8617;</a></li>
