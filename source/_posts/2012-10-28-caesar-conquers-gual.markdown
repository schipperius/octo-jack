par3-sen1:


par3-sen2: These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_wars" title="Gallic Wars">Gallic wars</a> as they became known, ended in 52 BC with a Roman victory in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alesia" title="Battle of Alesia">Battle of Alesia</a>, led by none other than Gaius Julius Caesar.

par3-sen3: This was a significant military victory for the Romans, effectively ending the majority of Gallic resistance to Rome. 



par3-sen4: As many as a million people (probably 1 in 5 of the Gauls) died, another million were enslaved, 300 tribes were subjugated and 800 cities were destroyed during the Gallic Wars. The entire population of the city of Avaricum (Bourges) (40,000 in all) were slaughtered.[10] During Julius Caesar's campaign against the Helvetii (present-day Switzerland) approximately 60% of the tribe was destroyed, and another 20% was taken into slavery.

 resulting in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul, and pushing their northern border to the river Rhine.
