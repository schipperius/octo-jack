para1: <p id="fnref:1.3">In fact, so little has changed in this house, the year could very well be 1582. It’s as though Christophe, his assistant Jan Moretus, and their staff of type founders, compositors, printers and proofreaders could walk in at any moment and begin their day’s work, the machinery, equipment and tools are all still here. <sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn:1.3" rel="tooltip">3</a></sup></p>
